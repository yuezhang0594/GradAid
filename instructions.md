# Personas
## Persona 1 - Li Lei
Li Lei, age 24, is a Chinese graduate student completing his MS degree in Biomedical Science. Originally from China, he earned his bachelor's degree in Chemistry before pursuing his master's studies. Li is passionate about scientific research and is determined to pursue a PhD in the United States to further his academic career. Despite his strong research background, he struggles with academic writing in English and is unfamiliar with the specific expectations of U.S. graduate applications. Li hopes to craft compelling Statements of Purpose (SOPs) and Letters of Recommendation (LORs) that effectively showcase his research achievements and align with his PhD aspirations. He views GradAid as an essential tool to generate professional, grammatically accurate documents tailored to his needs while helping him refine his tone and clarity for a natural-sounding application.
## Persona 2 - Astha Jain
Astha Jain, a 28-year-old from Jaipur, India, comes from a large family and was the first to attend college. She pursued her passion for medicine at Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences and Technology, earning a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree with high marks. Although she initially aspired to become a surgeon, she faced challenges finding employment immediately after graduation. Relocating to New Delhi in search of opportunities, she worked as a server to support herself while continuing her job search. Eventually, she secured a position as a junior doctor at a family medicine practice, where she worked for two years until the practice closed due to financial difficulties. Following this setback, she accepted a nursing position at Jeewan Mala Hospital in New Delhi. This career detour, coupled with the demanding hours of her new role, has prompted her to re-evaluate her career path. She now plans to pursue a graduate degree in a growing and more lucrative field, such as computer science or finance. Having saved enough money to study in the United States, she hopes that a graduate degree from a top American university will open doors to high-paying jobs, enabling her to support her aging parents, whose ability to work is diminishing.
Unsure of which specific field to pursue, Astha is finding it difficult to identify suitable programs. Even when she finds a seemingly appropriate program, she struggles to articulate her diverse experiences in a compelling Statement of Purpose (SOP). While acknowledging that her career journey has been unconventional, she recognizes the valuable lessons and transferable skills she has acquired along the way. She believes that an educational consultant could be instrumental in navigating the application process by understanding her unique story, her personal journey, and her future ambitions.
## Persona 3 - Carlos Mendoza
Carlos Mendoza, age 26, is a software engineer from Mexico City with four years of experience in backend development. He earned his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UNAM and has worked at a mid-sized tech company. Carlos has always been passionate about AI and machine learning and wants to pivot into research, but his current job focuses more on software development rather than deep AI work.
He plans to apply for an MS in Artificial Intelligence in the United States to gain the necessary academic background to transition into AI research roles. However, he is unfamiliar with the research-heavy SOPs required for graduate applications and has limited experience writing formal academic documents in English. He is also unsure how to best frame his work experience to demonstrate its relevance to AI research. He hopes GradAid will help him craft a strong SOP that highlights his technical background while showcasing his research potential in AI.

# Scenarios
## Scenario 1 - Li Lei
Li Lei, a 24-year-old Chinese graduate student completing his MS in Biomedical Science, is preparing to apply for PhD programs in the United States. With a BS in Chemistry and extensive research experience, he is eager to continue his academic journey in biomedical innovation. However, he faces significant challenges in crafting a compelling application due to his limited English proficiency and unfamiliarity with the tone, structure, and expectations of U.S. graduate admissions. Writing a strong Statement of Purpose (SOP) and securing well-crafted Letters of Recommendation (LORs) feels overwhelming, as he struggles to articulate his research achievements and career goals in a way that resonates with admissions committees.
To overcome these challenges, Li turns to GradAid, which helps him generate well-structured, grammatically accurate SOPs and LORs tailored to his background and aspirations. By inputting key details about his academic journey and research experience, he receives personalized drafts that he can refine using GradAid's tone adjustment and clarity-enhancing features. The platform also provides research-focused suggestions to ensure his documents align with the expectations of specific PhD programs. With GradAid's support, Li gains confidence in his application, knowing that his materials effectively highlight his strengths and are presented in a professional, natural-sounding manner.
## Scenario 2 - Astha Jain
Astha is determined to pursue a graduate degree in the US, but the application process feels overwhelming. Remembering a friend's recommendation, she opens her browser and navigates to GradAid.com. Astha clicks the "Get Started" button and begins interacting with GradAid's AI chatbot.
GradAid asks her a series of questions: her background, academic achievements, work experience, career aspirations, and preferred fields of study. Astha appreciates how GradAid's conversational interface makes it easy to share her story, even the less conventional parts. She explains her medical background, her shift to nursing, and her desire to transition into a more lucrative and stable career to support her parents. Based on Astha's input, GradAid's AI analyzes her profile and generates a list of potential graduate programs in computer science and finance at universities across the US. The recommendations are tailored to her academic record, work history, and career goals. Astha is impressed by the breadth and relevance of the suggestions. 
Astha selects a few programs that pique her interest. She knows the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is crucial, and it's where she's been struggling the most. Thankfully, GradAid offers an SOP brainstorming tool. GradAid's AI generates a series of prompts and potential themes for her SOP, suggesting ways to connect her seemingly disparate experiences into a cohesive narrative. Astha finds this incredibly helpful, as she's able to recognize the transferable skills she's gained, like problem-solving, communication, and adaptability.
## Scenario 3 -Carlos Mendoza
Carlos has started drafting his Statement of Purpose (SOP) for MS programs in AI, but he's struggling to connect his industry experience in backend development to his passion for machine learning. Unsure of how to frame his background, he logs into GradAid and inputs details about his education, work experience, and research interests.
GradAid analyzes his profile and suggests ways to highlight transferable skills from his software engineering background, such as his experience working with large datasets, optimization algorithms, and distributed computing. The AI-generated SOP draft weaves his technical experience into a compelling narrative, emphasizing how his work has naturally led him toward AI research. The platform also offers AI-powered editing tools to refine the language, ensuring his SOP is both professional and persuasive.
## Scenario 4 - Carlos Mendoza
Carlos has shortlisted five MS programs in AI, each with slightly different focuses—some emphasize research, while others are more industry-oriented. He wants to tailor his SOP for each program but doesn't know how to efficiently modify his content.
Using GradAid's customization feature, he selects the target programs and receives program-specific suggestions for refining his SOP. The tool highlights key faculty members and research labs he should mention, recommends how to emphasize certain skills based on each program's focus, and adjusts the wording to align with the expectations of research vs. industry-focused programs. With GradAid's help, Carlos creates tailored versions of his SOP, increasing his chances of securing admission.
